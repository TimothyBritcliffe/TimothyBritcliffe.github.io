            <hr>
            <p>Hello, I'm Timothy Britcliffe, a passionate student at Thompson Rivers University (Kamloops). I enjoy working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to make websites such as the website you are currently reading this from, I have some educational experience and personal project experience with Android Studio development with Java and XML, and outside of university I have also spent a considerable amount of free time freelancing Discord bots for various clients around the world. I have always enjoyed technology and I really enjoy making apps/websites and being able to see them in action.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Take a peek at some of the projects I have worked on and experiment with them a bit, and feel free to get in touch with me whether it's regarding a suggestion for one of my projects, or job opportunities.</p>
