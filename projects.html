				<h3>BitURL - Flask Project</h3>
				<p>I made a basic project utilizing SQLite databases, Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to make a URL shortener similar to LinkVertise however the system rewards users with cryptocurrency. The project has a user registration and login system, URL shortener with rewards, and a 'casino' portion where users can use their earned in-app funds to play some games like coinflip, roulette, etc.</p>

                <h3>SimpleNFT - COMP 2160 Final Project</h3>
                <p>For COMP 2160 at Thompson Rivers University, a friend and I made an enclosed NFT application. It has user login/registration, the ability to draw in-app, NFT minting/buying/selling, and allows people to turn their own images into an NFT the simple way.</p>
                <p><em>Note: The project is not connected to any databases or blockchain technology currently.</em></p>

                <h3>SmartPark - Kamloops Hackathon 2023</h3>
                <p>For the 2023 hackathon we made a parking website prototype called 'SmartPark' the goal of this project was to not only allow users to pay for parking in-app, but to also offer analytics about the specific parking lot such as the number of available spots which would reduce time-waste and carbon-emissions used while drivers are in search of a parking lot with availability.</p>
                <p><em>Note: The project is not functional, it is just what the interface would look like.</em></p>

                <h3>Safasr Services Discord Bot</h3>
                <p>This was a freelance project where I made a Discord bot for a freelance community. The bot consists of allowing administrators to make new products as well as sell preset products. It has a review/rating system, server-user verification, ticket usage, use of buttons, and general-info messages.</p>
